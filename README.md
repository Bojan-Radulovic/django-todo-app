## General info
This project was made by me as a college course assignment. It is a work in progress shared to-do list app that features a list of all users, tasks and reminders and to-do lists (including all of their users, tasks and reminders). The app can also show information about a specific user as well as just one specific user's to-do lists. For testing purposes, the project also includes a make_data.py script that generates random test data using the Factory boy module
## Technologies
* Python 3.9
* Django web framework
* Factory boy
## Use
From a terminal in the root folder, start the server with ./manage.py runserver. From there you can navigate to any of the app views using the apps navigation
